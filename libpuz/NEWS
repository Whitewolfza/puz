1.0.0 (March 11, 2010) includes a variety of bug fixes and is thought
  to be relatively stable, based on use the application hcross.

0.0.2 adds support for various special features, like circles,
  rebuses, timers, etc.  Also various bug fixes.

0.0.1 is the initial release, so there's either not much NEWS, or
  everything is NEWS. =)
